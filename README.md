A* pathfinding and movement system in C# and MonoGame.

I have been working on this code for the past two years. I hope you appreciate it and hope it helps you with your own projects.

This is project is taken from my engine, Vault-Tech engine.

This project contains my rendering code and the A* algorithm that supports and is working on multi-threading. It also has the waypoint system.

This project is running on version V3.3.0.2210 of Monogame. As of today, 12/June/2016, the current version of Monogame is 3.5.1.

If you have any question please feel free to email me or comment on my website and I will make sure to answer you.

Good luck. Enjoy ^_^
